Project Description: Sales Insights Dashboard

The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive sales insights dashboard that provides valuable information
and visualizations to support data-driven decision-making. The dashboard will showcase sales data in a one-page layout, 
utilizing various visuals to effectively represent the available data.

1. Data Gathering / Requirement:
The following data sources will be used to assemble the sales reports and create the dashboard:

> Sales data: Organized in a folder structure by year.
> Categories: Provided in an Excel format.
> Geography: Provided in an Excel format.
> Product: Available in a CSV or database format.
> > SalesRep: Provided in an Excel format.
> SubCategories: Provided in an Excel format.

Task 1.1: Data Loading Mechanism
A mechanism will be developed to load all the files from the sales folder into a single Sales fact table. 
This mechanism should be resilient, meaning that removing a file from the sales folder should not result in errors, and 
adding a new yearly sales file should be automatically loaded into the fact query upon refresh.

2. Data Modeling:

Task 2.1: Transformations to Sales Fact Table
Transformations will be applied to the Sales fact table to split the country and city into the "Location" field. Correct
data types will be set to allow for geographic mapping. Additionally, updates will be made to the Date field to 
ensure the correct date format can be set.

Task 2.2: Creating Unique Keys
Unique keys (GeoKey) will be created in both the Sales and Geography tables to establish relationships between them.

Task 2.3: Dimensional Query Treatment
The dimensional queries for SalesRep and Sub Category require additional treatment. Some ID columns have a specific format. 
A small function will be created to remove the "ID - " part from these columns, which can be invoked and reused for these 
two queries to clean the IDs.

Task 2.4: Data Model Creation
A data model will be created by connecting all tables and utilizing the pre-existing Calendar table available in the Power 
BI file (pbix).

3. DAX Calculations:
Several DAX calculations will be implemented to derive important measures for the sales insights:

Task 3.1: Total Revenue calculation based on the product's retail price multiplied by the units sold.
Task 3.2: Total Cost calculation based on the product's standard cost multiplied by the units sold.
Task 3.3: Gross Profit calculation as the difference between Total Revenue and Total Cost.
Task 3.4: Gross Profit Month-over-Month (MoM) growth Change% measure for decision-making.
Task 3.5: Average sales per day calculation by summing the Total Revenue per day based on actual sales dates.
Task 3.7: Breakdown Analysis by Product for identifying any drop or increase. Time measures like Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) growth 
will also be calculated for the QBR (Quarterly Business Review) report.

4. Creating the Sales Reports Dashboard:
Using the derived measures and calculations, a one-page sales reports dashboard will be created. Various visuals will be 
employed to effectively showcase the sales insights. The dashboard design will be flexible, allowing for creative representation 
of the available data. When plotting the month on the x-axis, proper sorting from January to December will be ensured.

By completing this project, stakeholders will gain valuable insights into sales performance and trends, enabling informed
decision-making and strategic planning. The sales insights dashboard will serve as a powerful tool to visualize and analyze 
the sales data in an intuitive and comprehensive manner.
